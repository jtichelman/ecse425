Fact:   add  $1, $0, $5         # input: n = 5


        addi  $2, $0, 1 	# initialize output to 1

Loop:   slti  $3, $1, 2         # if input is less than 2
        bne   $3, $0, Skip      # then skip to return



				mult  $1, $2            # else multiply input and running product
        mflo  $2                # assume small numbers
			addi  $1, $1, -1        # decrement input
        j Loop                  # and loop
